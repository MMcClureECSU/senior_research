 a research project on sentiment analysis of twitter data

This project will detail my process in developing a python script to pull data from Twitter and analyze the sentiment. The code will pull the maximun amount of tweets allowed by one person in a 15 minute period by Twitter's API. A library called Textblob will be used to analyze the data.
